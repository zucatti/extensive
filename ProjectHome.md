The goal of this project is to provide a MVC framework to easily create widgets using ExtJS.
To ensure the suggested MVC architecture, generator scripts similar to Rails are provided.
Using the 'create-controller' script it is possible for example to generate a controller for the widget.
The scripts are written in Javascript themself and invoked using the shell of Mozilla Rhino.
Apart form the architecture additional ExtJS components are included in the package.
These additional components require ExtJS altough the framework itself may be used with Ext Core.
